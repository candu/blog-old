## My Report

### Charts

My happiness is *relatively constant across days of the week.*

{% img https://chart.googleapis.com/chart?chs=310x200&cht=bvg&chco=0088cc&chxt=x%2Cy&chxl=0%3A%7CSun%7CMon%7CTue%7CWed%7CThu%7CFri%7CSat&chxr=1%2C0%2C100&chxs=0%2C666666%2C10%7C1%2C666666%2C10&chd=s%3Aolpkmkp&chbh=30 Weekday %}

I'm *happiest at the gym or in parks*, with vacations and restaurants close
behind. "At Home" is mid-pack, with *"At Work" near the bottom.*

*Fun, exercise, and food* generate the most happiness. *Passive actions* such as
watching TV, commuting, and waiting rank much lower. *Work is least
happiness-inducing.*

*Whether I want to perform a task* is a much stronger determinant of happiness
than whether I have to:

{% img https://chart.googleapis.com/chart?chs=310x200&cht=bvg&chco=0088cc&chxt=x%2Cx%2Cy&chxl=0%3A%7CDon%27t+want+to%7CWant+to%7CWant+to%7CDon%27t+want+to%7C1%3A%7CHave+to%7CHave+to%7CDon%27t+have+to%7CDon%27t+have+to&chxr=2%2C0%2C100&chxs=0%2C666666%2C10%7C1%2C666666%2C10%7C2%2C666666%2C10&chd=s%3Agope&chbh=51 Want to / Have to %}

I'm *happier when outside.*

{% img https://chart.googleapis.com/chart?chs=310x126&cht=bhg&chco=0088cc&chxt=y%2Cx&chxl=0%3A%7CNo%7CYes&chxr=1%2C0%2C100&chxs=0%2C666666%2C10%7C1%2C666666%2C10&chd=s%3Apj&chbh=40 Outside? %}

I'm *happier when alone.*

{% img https://chart.googleapis.com/chart?chs=310x126&cht=bhg&chco=0088cc&chxt=y%2Cx&chxl=0%3A%7CNo%7CYes&chxr=1%2C0%2C100&chxs=0%2C666666%2C10%7C1%2C666666%2C10&chd=s%3Apl&chbh=40 Alone %}

Given that, it seems counterintuitive that *I'm happier when interacting with
multiple people.*

{% img https://chart.googleapis.com/chart?chs=310x132&cht=bhg&chco=0088cc&chxt=y%2Cx&chxl=0%3A%7CThree+Or+More%7CTwo%7COne&chxr=1%2C0%2C100&chxs=0%2C666666%2C10%7C1%2C666666%2C10&chd=s%3Aorq&chbh=26 Number of people interacting with %}

I was also surprised by this one: I'm happiest when *talking with acquaintances
or friends* and least happy when *talking with family.*

### What Does It Mean?

Even without considering the specific results, I have a few *unanswered
questions:*

- What is *happiness*? How do I judge it at a particular moment? Is my
  judgment *accurate and consistent?*
- Is it necessarily better to be happier, or is there a
  threshold past which additional happiness doesn't improve the quality of life?
- Are these results *significant?* They're computed from just 50 samples, which
  seems low for drawing such broad conclusions.
- Do these activities make me more or less happy, or *do these readings reflect
  my pre-existing mental state?*

There's also the issue of those surprising findings. Am I really less happy
when talking with [Valkyrie Savage](http://www.eecs.berkeley.edu/~valkyrie/)? To me, the most likely
explanation is *trust*: around her, *I feel free to discuss negative aspects
of my life.* Doing so would necessarily involve fixating on those aspects,
which could account for some happiness reduction.

During this period, I was confronting *doubt and frustration in
my job.* According to my personal data, I was also [drinking heavily](/blog/2012/10/08/self-tracking-for-panic-a-deeper-look/),
possibly as a means for coping with that negative emotion. (It doesn't help.)
Guilt is a potential factor; perhaps I felt
that I was always offloading that doubt and frustration onto her.

The problem, though, is that *none of these explanations are testable*. They seem
reasonable to me, but from a scientific standpoint they *fail a simple criterion:*

{% blockquote %}
Upon viewing only my data, would an impartial stranger reach similar conclusions?
{% endblockquote %}

I can't see how they would, since *my explanations involve
intricate self-knowledge* that is not represented in the data.

### A Further Note On Significance

Let's take a more critical look at this chart:

{% img https://chart.googleapis.com/chart?chs=310x198&cht=bhg&chco=0088cc&chxt=y%2Cx&chxl=0%3A%7COther+Relatives%7CSpouse%2FPartner%2FSignificant+Other%7CStrangers%7CCo+Workers%7CFriends%7CAcquaintances&chxr=1%2C0%2C100&chxs=0%2C666666%2C10%7C1%2C666666%2C10&chd=s%3Autsrpo&chbh=20 Who talking with %}

I mentioned that this data was drawn from a total of 50 samples. I'm assuming
that these bars represent *average reported happiness* in each category. But:

- **Which average?** Probably the mean, but that's not made explicit
  anywhere.
- **Where are the error bars?** I have no idea whether the ranking is significant.
- **How many samples go into each bar?** Maybe "Acquaintances" and
  "Other Relatives" are outliers because I rarely talk to people in those
  categories.

This leads to an important point:

{% blockquote %}
Never present uncertain information as certain.
{% endblockquote %}

## Digging Deeper

Consider this chart:

{% img https://chart.googleapis.com/chart?chs=310x200&cht=s&chco=0088cc&chxt=x%2Cy&chxr=0%2C0%2C100%7C1%2C0%2C100&chxs=0%2C666666%2C10%7C1%2C666666%2C10&chd=s%3AaUXKPnmomsWw0tSQnXaVrk%2CslrjjuZtXvZotualhrmepm Focused %}

*Am I happier when I'm more focused?* It's hard to tell from looking at this
chart. This is a prime use case for *linear regression*, but I don't have the
data! They [claim to have plans for data export](http://support.trackyourhappiness.org/customer/portal/questions/302357-combine-categories-), but I haven't seen those
come to fruition. What now?

### Data Extraction

Fortunately, the chart was generated using the 
(now deprecated) [Image Charts](https://developers.google.com/chart/image/) functionality of the
[Google Charts API](https://developers.google.com/chart/). With Image Charts, you *make requests to specially
encoded URLs:*

{% codeblock %}
https://chart.googleapis.com/chart
  ?chs=310x200
  &cht=s
  &chco=0088cc
  &chxt=x%2Cy
  &chxr=0%2C0%2C100%7C1%2C0%2C100
  &chxs=0%2C666666%2C10%7C1%2C666666%2C10
  &chd=s%3AaUXKPnmomsWw0tSQnXaVrk%2CslrjjuZtXvZotualhrmepm
{% endcodeblock %}

You can see what all those parameters do [here](https://developers.google.com/chart/image/docs/chart_params),
but the one I really care about is `chd`. This *encodes the chart data*
in the [Simple Encoding Format](https://developers.google.com/chart/image/docs/data_formats#simple). I'll walk through *how to decode
this data.*

As it stands, the value of `chd` is [URL-encoded](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3986#section-2.1).
We need to decode those `%3A` and `%2C` escape sequences.

{% codeblock lang:py %}
import urlparse
params = urlparse.parse_qs('chd=s%3AaUXKPnmomsWw0tSQnXaVrk%2CslrjjuZtXvZotualhrmepm')
chd = params['chd'] # 's:aUXKPnmomsWw0tSQnXaVrk,slrjjuZtXvZotualhrmepm'
{% endcodeblock %}

The `s:` at the front means *use the simple encoding*. In that encoding, the
characters `A-Za-z0-9` are mapped to values 0-61 in a, well, simple manner:

{% codeblock lang:py %}
def _get_simple_value(c):
  if c == '_':
    return None
  if 'A' <= c <= 'Z':
    return ord(c) - ord('A')
  if 'a' <= c <= 'z':
    return 26 + ord(c) - ord('a')
  if '0' <= c <= '9':
    return 52 + ord(c) - ord('0')
  raise ValueError('invalid character for simple encoding: {0}'.format(c))
{% endcodeblock %}

Here the underscores `_` indicate missing or `null` values. With this function,
recovering the original data from the `chd` param is a quick one-liner:

{% codeblock lang:py %}
data = [map(_get_simple_value, s) for s in chd[2:].split(',')]
{% endcodeblock %}

By default, the simple encoding maps onto an effective range of 1-100, so the
last step is to normalize this and `zip()` the lists into pairs:

{% codeblock lang:py %}
def fitSimpleToRange(x, xmin, xmax):
  if x is None:
    return None
  nx = x / 61.0
  return (1.0 - nx) * xmin + nx * xmax

points = zip(
  [fitSimpleToRange(x, 0, 100) for x in data[0]],
  [fitSimpleToRange(y, 0, 100) for y in data[1]]
)
{% endcodeblock %}

Done! I've packaged this up as [chdecode](https://github.com/candu/quantified-savagery-files/blob/master/lib/py/chdecode.py),
which also deals with the
[Basic Text](https://developers.google.com/chart/image/docs/data_formats#text) and [Extended Encoding](https://developers.google.com/chart/image/docs/data_formats#extended) formats.

### Let's See Those Charts Again

You can see the code for this analysis [here](https://github.com/candu/quantified-savagery-files/blob/master/Panic/track-your-happiness/linregress.py).

Focus, productivity, and sleep quality all have *minor positive correlations*
with happiness:

{% img https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-DG51p79XNtk/UIGcRjGMLQI/AAAAAAAAAG4/mk1xaar0yJM/s640/happiness-focus.jpg Focus %}
{% img https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-85nu0a-MBJw/UIGcRyutW9I/AAAAAAAAAG8/psRbjq12PLw/s640/happiness-productivity.jpg Productivity %}
{% img https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-bjcS4-21xIw/UIGcSLK9mCI/AAAAAAAAAHA/EVJ1qonZvks/s640/happiness-sleep-quality.jpg Sleep Quality %}

The *most significant one is focus,* but with $ p = 0.0927 $ it doesn't quite
make the 5% significance threshold.
