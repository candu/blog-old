Over the holidays, I received a 23andMe genetic testing kit as a gift. In
this post, I'll take a look at my results through the lens of prospect
theory, which aims to quantify our perception of risk. 23andMe results
estimate your lifetime likelihood of various medical conditions, making them
a great dataset for testing out these concepts in behavioral economics.

## Prospect Theory: A Quick Example

Suppose I offer you a bet. I flip a fair coin once. Heads, you
gain \\$ 1000; tails, you lose \\$ 900. Do you take the bet? Probability
dictates that you should, since you would expect to come out
$ (1000 - 900) / 2 = 50 $ dollars ahead.

If you're like most people, though, you have a *powerful aversion* to losing
\\$ 900. This aversion is powerful enough that you'll decline the bet. This
only makes sense if losing \\$ 900 has a greater negative value than the positive
value of gaining \\$ 1000. In other words, your perception of value is
*non-linear*. This perception underpins many real-world bets that
make little sense from an expected utility standpoint:

- *Insurance:* the buyer takes a small certain loss to avoid the risk of an
  uncertain and potentially large loss;
- *Security:* the property owner takes a small certain loss to reduce the
  risk of an uncertain and potentially large loss;
- *Lotteries:* the ticket holder takes a small certain loss to try for an
  extremely unlikely but massive gain.

[Prospect theory](http://www.princeton.edu/~kahneman/docs/Publications/prospect_theory.pdf) creates a mathematical framework for understanding our
perceptions of value and risk. It's an awesome paper with highly
approachable mathematics. Definitely recommended reading for anyone
interested in economics, game theory, and the like.

## My Disease Risk

Among other things, 23andMe can estimate your lifetime risk of various
diseases. This information is divided into three categories according to
whether your risk is highly elevated, highly decreased, or roughly typical:

{% img https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-xccLcJ7-CqU/URBE7QF2tCI/AAAAAAAAATs/sFewavaz6P4/s640/23andme_elevated_risk.jpg %}
{% img https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-D7AY4foE6Qs/URBE8FA3lBI/AAAAAAAAAT0/x76tZ9J5HP0/s640/23andme_decreased_risk.jpg %}
{% img https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-HU05eMXwI4M/URBE89TEu0I/AAAAAAAAAT8/MihVGsTQkLQ/s640/23andme_typical_risk.jpg %}

Within each category, the diseases are ordered by decreasing confidence
rating, then by decreasing absolute risk. The different confidence levels
are as follows:

1. *Preliminary Research:* fewer than 100 people studied
2. *Preliminary Research:* fewer than 750 people studied 
3. *Preliminary Research:* a single study with 750+ participants
4. *Established Research:* multiple studies with 750+ participants

The 23andMe dashboard doesn't show estimated risk for lower-confidence
findings, but I can fetch that information through their [API](https://api.23andme.com/).

Armed with my raw risk data, I can now play around with a pair of alternative
disease rankings. As an anchoring point, here's my disease ranking by
absolute risk:

### Perceived Relative-Risk Sorting

In prospect theory, a probability $ p $ has perceived weight $ w(p) $.
In [Advances in Prospect Theory: Cumulative Representation of Uncertainty](http://psych.fullerton.edu/mBIRNBAUM/psych466/articles/Tversky_Kahneman_JRU_92.pdf),
Tversky and Kahneman fit $ w $ to observed results for subjects evaluating
bets similar to the one listed above:

{% img https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-5qE_0uX1hdI/URBE9pc7ViI/AAAAAAAAAUE/Y-zgLP8Yp-8/s400/prospect_positive_graph.jpg %}
{% img https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-UWfKR_J2RBs/URBE-Dj67nI/AAAAAAAAAUM/CpO_z7VnPbM/s400/prospect_negative_graph.jpg %}


The corresponding equations are

$$
w^+(p) = \frac{p^{0.61}}{(p^{0.61} + (1-p)^{0.61})^{\frac{1}{0.61}}}
$$

for positive prospects and

$$
w^-(p) = \frac{p^{0.69}}{(p^{0.69} + (1-p)^{0.69})^{\frac{1}{0.69}}}
$$

for negative prospects. If my risk is $ p_0 $ and the general risk is $ p $,
I can define my perceived relative risk as

$$
r = \frac{w^+(p_0)}{w^+(p)}
$$

if $ p_0 < p $ (I consider decreased risk as a positive prospect!) and

$$
r = \frac{w^-(p_0)}{w^-(p)}
$$

otherwise. The resulting rankings are pretty close to ordinary relative
risk, but not identical:

{% endcodeblock %}

The difference is due to distortion of small probabilities.

## Further Ideas

So far, I've only used the probability weighting functions from prospect
theory. I could also assign values to each disease:

- *Financial:* how much does this disease cost to treat on average?
- *Reduced Life Expectancy:* how many years of potential life do these
  diseases claim on average?
- *Lifestyle:* how much impact would this have on my highly active lifestyle?
  On others who might have to support me? 

This is definitely morbid, but it's also potentially worthwhile. After all,
insurance companies make *very detailed estimates of our risk.* They will
certainly incorporate genetic data into their models as soon as it's legal to
do so. If we want to make more informed decisions in situations involving risk,
from medical insurance to lottery tickets, it helps to understand how we
value different outcomes.

## Appendix: How To Use The 23andMe API

The 23andMe API is actually quite easy to use, and their [documentation](https://api.23andme.com/docs/authentication/)
is excellent. Nevertheless, I'll list the flow I went through to get my
genetic disease risk data. If you're unfamiliar with [OAuth 2.0](http://oauth.net/2/),
the Google API docs include [this primer](https://developers.google.com/accounts/docs/OAuth2) complete with cute stick
figure diagrams.

First, I log into the API console and create an app.
This gives me the `client_id` and `client_secret` parameters I need to
initiate the flow. Looking at the [23andMe API reference](https://api.23andme.com/docs/reference/), I see that I need
permissions under the `analyses` scope, so I request that by visiting

{% codeblock %}
https://api.23andme.com/authorize/?redirect_uri=http://localhost:5000/receive_code/&response_type=code&client_id=<client_id>&scope=analyses
{% endcodeblock %}

in the browser. I'm redirected to

{% codeblock %}
http://localhost:5000/receive_code/?code=<code>
{% endcodeblock %}

which gives me the auth code I need to request a token:

{% codeblock %}
$ curl https://api.23andme.com/token/ \
  -d client_id=<client_id> \
  -d client_secret=<client_secret> \
  -d code=<code> \
  -d grant_type=authorization_code \
  -d "redirect_uri=http://localhost:5000/receive_code/" \
  -d scope=analyses > token.json
$ jsonpp token.json
{
  "access_token": "<access_token>"
  "token_type": "bearer",
  "expires_in": 86400,
  "refresh_token": "<refresh_token>"
  "scope": "analyses"
}
{% endcodeblock %}

Finally, I use my shiny new `access_token` to get my genetic risk data:

{% codeblock %}
$ curl https://api.23andme.com/1/risks/ \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <access_token>" > risks.json
$ jsonpp risks.json | head
[
  {
    "id": "6d2de403675a0d07",
    "risks": [
      {
        "description": "Atrial Fibrillation",
        "risk": 0.3392,
        "population_risk": 0.2715,
        "report_id": "atrialfib"
      },
{% endcodeblock %}
