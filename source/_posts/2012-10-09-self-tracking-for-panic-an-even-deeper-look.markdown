In this post, I apply three statistical and machine learning tools to my panic
recovery journal data: linear regression/correlation, the Fast Fourier
Transform, and maximum entropy modelling.

<!-- more -->

## First, A Word About Tools

{% blockquote Abraham Maslow, The Psychology of Science: A Reconnaissance %}
I suppose it is tempting, if the only tool you have is a hammer, to treat
everything as if it were a nail.
{% endblockquote %}

## Now, A Necessary Disclaimer

My experiment has fewer than 50 samples, which is *nowhere near enough to draw
statistically significant conclusions*. That's not the point. The primary
purpose of this post is to *demonstrate analysis techniques by example*. These
same methods can be wielded on larger datasets, where they are much more
useful.

## Getting Ready

To follow along with the examples here, you'll need
the excellent Python toolkits
[scipy](http://scipy.org/),
[matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org/), and
[nltk](http://nltk.org/):

{% codeblock %}
$ pip install scipy nltk matplotlib
{% endcodeblock %}

## Linear Regression

### What?

Linear regression answers this question:

{% blockquote %}
What is the line that most closely fits this data?
{% endblockquote %}

Given points $ P_i = (x_i, y_i) $, the goal is to find the line
$ y = mx + b $ such that some error function is minimized.
A common one is the least squares function:

$$
f(m, b) = \sum_{i} \left(y_i - (mx_i + b)\right)^2
$$

The
[Pearson correlation coefficient](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pearson_product-moment_correlation_coefficient) $ R $ and
[p-value](http://www.lstr.net/blog/2008/07/08/p-values-explained-well/) $ p $
are also useful here, as they measure *correlation* and *statistical
significance*.

### Why?

In a self-tracking context, you might ask the following questions:

- Have I been exercising more over time?
- Does exercise affect mood? By how much and in what direction?

Linear regression can help address both questions. However, it can only find
*linear* relationships between datasets. Many dynamic processes are *locally linear*
but not *globally linear*. For instance, there are practical limits to how
much you can exercise in a day, so no linear model with non-zero slope will
accurately capture your exercise duration for all time.

### The Data

You can see the code for this analysis [here](https://github.com/candu/quantified-savagery-files/blob/master/Panic/recovery-journal/food_linregress.py). I look at only the first
31 days, that being the largest consecutive run for which I have data.

{% img https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-plD2webhfrY/UHXc4xHxAGI/AAAAAAAAACM/2X488DqHKms/s640/alcohol.jpg Alcohol Consumption %}

My alcohol consumption did not decrease over time, but rather stayed fairly
constant: with $ R = 0.0098 $, there is no correlation between alcohol and time.

{% img https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-UCZKlx5l5RI/UHXc6u8h2vI/AAAAAAAAACs/CWcJjS09dS8/s640/sweets.jpg Sugar Consumption %}

Sugar consumption is a similar story: although the best-fit slope is slightly
negative, $ R = -0.0671 $ indicates no correlation over time. It seems that my
alcohol and sugar consumption were not modified significantly over the tracking
period.

{% img https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-Ssz89uoE-EA/UHXc5DvHf0I/AAAAAAAAACU/o0C_PJpmZcM/s640/alcohol-and-sugar.jpg Alcohol and Sugar Consumption %}

I decided to graph alcohol and sugar together. It looks like they might be
related, as the peaks in each seem to coincide on several occasions. Let's
test this hypothesis:

{% img https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-iCO9umA8L8s/UHXc5vImvhI/AAAAAAAAACc/d82SCqFs-qI/s640/alcohol-today-vs-yesterday.jpg Alcohol vs. Sugar Consumption %}

The positive slope is more pronounced this time, but
$ R = 0.1624 $ still indicates a small degree of correlation. We can also look
at the p-value: with $ p = 0.3827 $, it is fairly easy to write this off as
a random effect.

Finally, let's take another look at a question from
[a previous blog post](/blog/2012/10/08/self-tracking-for-panic-a-deeper-look/):

{% blockquote %}
On days where I drink heavily, do I drink less the day after?
{% endblockquote %}

{% img https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-iCO9umA8L8s/UHXc5vImvhI/AAAAAAAAACc/d82SCqFs-qI/s640/alcohol-today-vs-yesterday.jpg Alcohol Consumption: Today vs. Yesterday %}

There's a negative slope there, but the correlation and p-value statistics are
in the same uncertain zone as before. I likely need more data to investigate
these last two effects properly.

## Fast Fourier Transform

### What?

Fourier analysis answers this question:

{% blockquote %}
What frequencies comprise this signal?
{% endblockquote %}

Given a sequence $ x_n $, a
[Discrete Fourier Transform](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discrete_Fourier_transform) (DFT)
computes

$$
X_k = \sum_{n=0}^{N-1} x_n \cdot e^{\frac{-2 i \pi k n}{N}}
$$

The $ X_k $ encode the amplitude and phase of frequencies
$ \frac{f k}{N} $ Hz, where $ T $ is the time between samples
and $ f = 1 / T $ is the sampling frequency.

As described here, the DFT requires $ \mathcal{O}(N^2) $ time to
compute. The [Fast Fourier Transform](http://mathworld.wolfram.com/FastFourierTransform.html) (FFT) uses
divide-and-conquer on this sum of complex exponentials to compute the DFT in
$ \mathcal{O}(N \log N) $ time. 
[Further speedups are possible](http://groups.csail.mit.edu/netmit/sFFT/) for
real-world signals that are sparse in the frequency domain.

### Why?

In a self-tracking context, you might ask the following questions:

- Do I have regular exercising patterns?
- Do these patterns cycle weekly? bi-weekly? monthly?
- How much does my amount of exercise fluctuate during a cycle?

With the FFT, Fourier analysis can help address these questions. However, it
can only find *periodic* effects. Unlike linear regression, it does not help
find *trends* in your data.

### The Data

You can see the code for this analysis [here](https://github.com/candu/quantified-savagery-files/blob/master/Panic/recovery-journal/food_fft.py). Again, I look at the
first 31 days to ensure that the frequency analysis is meaningful.

{% img https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-8j00ob_Ji-Y/UHXc67MQVpI/AAAAAAAAAC0/n3akVSjtRHs/s640/fft-frequencies.jpg Frequency Strengths %}

There are some apparent maxima there, but it's hard to tell what they
mean. Part of the difficulty is that *these are frequencies rather than
period lengths*, so let's deal with that:

{% codeblock %}
$ python food_fft.py 
food_fft.py:32: RuntimeWarning: divide by zero encountered in divide
  for strength, phase, period in sorted(zip(FS, FP, 1.0 / Q))[-5:]:
[2.21 days] 3.0461 (phase=-0.67 days)
[-2.21 days] 3.0461 (phase=-0.67 days)
[7.75 days] 3.1116 (phase=-3.67 days)
[-7.75 days] 3.1116 (phase=-3.67 days)
food_fft.py:33: RuntimeWarning: invalid value encountered in double_scalars
  phase_days = period * (phase / (2.0 * math.pi))
[inf days] 18.1401 (phase=nan days)
{% endcodeblock %}

If you're not familiar with the Fourier transform,
the last line might be a bit mysterious. That corresponds to $ X_0 $, which
is just the sum of the original samples:

$$
X_0 = \sum_{n=0}^{N-1} x_n \cdot e^0 = \sum_{n=0}^{N-1} x_n
$$

Other than that, the most pronounced cycles have period lengths of
2.21 days and 7.75 days. The former might be explained by a *see-saw drinking
pattern*, whereas the latter is likely related to the day-of-week effects
we saw [in the previous post](/blog/2012/10/08/self-tracking-for-panic-a-deeper-look/).

Which day of the week? The phase is -3.67 days, and our sample starts on a
Monday, placing the first peak on Thursday. The period is slightly longer than
a week, though, and the data runs for 31 days, so these peaks gradually shift
to *cover the weekend*.

There are two caveats:

1. I have no idea whether a Fourier coefficient of about 3 is significant
   here. If it isn't, I'm grasping at straws.
2. Again, the small amount of data means the frequency domain data is sparse.
   To accurately test for bi-daily or weekly effects, I *need more
   fine-grained period lengths.*

## Maximum Entropy Modelling

### What?

Maximum entropy modelling answers this question:

{% blockquote %}
Given observations of a random process, what is the most likely model
for that random process?
{% endblockquote %}

Given a discrete probability distribution $ p(X = x_k) = p_k $, the entropy
of this distribution is given by

$$
H(p) = \sum - p_k \log p_k
$$

(Yes, I'm conflating the concepts of
[random variables](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_variable) and
[probability distributions](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability_distribution).
If you knew that, you probably don't need this explanation.)

This can be thought of as the *number of bits needed to encode outcomes
in this distribution*. For instance, if I have a double-headed coin, I need
no bits: I already know the outcome. Given a fair coin, though, I need one bit:
heads or tails?

After repeated sampling, we get observed expected values for $ p_k $;
let these be $ p'_k $. Since we would like the model to *accurately
reflect what we already know*, we impose the constraints $ p_k = p'_k $.
The maximum entropy model is the model that also maximizes $ H(p') $.

This model encodes what is known
*while remaining maximally noncommittal on what is unknown.*

Adam Berger (CMU) provides [a more concrete example](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/afs/cs/user/aberger/www/html/tutorial/node2.html#SECTION00011000000000000000).
If you're interested in learning more, his tutorial is highly recommended
reading.

### Why?

In a self-tracking context, you might ask the following questions:

- Which treatments have the greatest effect in preventing panic attacks?
  Which have the least effect?
- Today I exercised for at least 30 minutes and had four drinks. Am I
  likely to get a panic attack?
- What treatments should I try next?

Maximum entropy modelling can help address these questions. It is often
used to *classify unseen examples*, and would be fantastic in a
[data commons](http://100plus.com/2012/09/qs-data-commons/) scenario
with enough data to provide recommendations to users. 

### Feature Extraction

Since I'm now effectively building a classifier, there's an additional step.
I need features for my classifier, which I extract from my existing datasets:

{% codeblock %}
train_set = []
dates = set(W).intersection(F)
for ds in dates:
  try:
    ds_data = {
      'relaxation' : bool(int(W[ds]['relaxation'])),
      'exercise' : bool(int(W[ds]['exercise'])),
      'caffeine' : int(F[ds]['caffeine']) > 0,
      'sweets' : int(F[ds]['sweets']) > 1,
      'alcohol' : int(F[ds]['alcohol']) > 4,
      'supplements' : bool(int(F[ds]['supplements']))
    }
  except (ValueError, KeyError):
    continue
  had_panic = P.get(ds) and 'panic' or 'no-panic'
  train_set.append((ds_data, had_panic))
{% endcodeblock %}

Note that the features listed here are binary. I use my daily goals as
thresholds on caffeine, sweets, and alcohol.

(If you know how to get float-valued features working with NLTK, let me know!
Otherwise, there's always [megam](http://www.cs.utah.edu/~hal/megam/) or
[YASMET](http://www-i6.informatik.rwth-aachen.de/web/Software/YASMET.html).

### The Data

You can see the code for this analysis [here](https://github.com/candu/quantified-savagery-files/blob/master/Panic/recovery-journal/panic_maxent.py).
This time I don't care about having consecutive dates, so I use all of the
samples

After building a `MaxentClassifier`, I print out the most informative features
with `show_most_informative_features()`:

{% codeblock %}
  -2.204 exercise==True and label is 'panic'
   1.821 caffeine==True and label is 'panic'
  -0.867 relaxation==True and label is 'panic'
   0.741 alcohol==True and label is 'panic'
  -0.615 caffeine==True and label is 'no-panic'
  -0.537 supplements==True and label is 'panic'
   0.439 sweets==True and label is 'panic'
   0.430 exercise==True and label is 'no-panic'
   0.284 relaxation==True and label is 'no-panic'
   0.233 supplements==True and label is 'no-panic'
{% endcodeblock %}

Exercise, relaxation breathing, and vitamin supplements help with panic.
Caffeine, alcohol, and sweets do not. I knew that already, but this suggests 
*which treatments or dietary factors have greatest impact.*

Let's consider the supplements finding more closely. Of the 45 days, I took
supplements on all but two. It's *dangerous* to draw any conclusions from a
feature for which there are very few negative samples.
This points out some important points about data analysis:

- **Know your data**: otherwise, you may *ascribe undue meaning to outliers or noise.*
- **Know your features:** supplements are probably not a good feature here.
  A *feature inclusion threshold* on number of positive and negative samples 
  might be helpful here.
- **Beware magic:** even when you understand their inner workings, *machine
  learning algorithms can produce results that are difficult to interpret.*

## Up Next

In my next post, I look at a panic recovery dataset gathered using
[qs-counters](https://github.com/candu/qs-counters), a simple utility I built to reduce friction in
self-tracking. I perform these same three analyses on the
[qs-counters dataset](https://github.com/candu/quantified-savagery-files/tree/master/Panic/qs-counters), then compare it to the
[recovery-journal dataset](https://github.com/candu/quantified-savagery-files/tree/master/Panic/recovery-journal).
