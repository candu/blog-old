In this post, I discuss cross-correlation. Although commonly used in signal
processing, cross-correlation can be useful in a Quantified Self context.
I'll present a bit of the mathematics behind cross-correlation, demonstrate
a quick example, and briefly explain where you might use this in analyzing
your personal data.

## The Inspiration

I was going through my [Google Reader](http://reader.google.com) queue this morning and
came across [this talk](http://vimeo.com/50329491) by [Jeff Zira](http://www.linkedin.com/in/jeffzira), a product manager at
[Lark Technologies](http://www.lark.com/). The talk asks a simple question:

{% blockquote %}
Do Jeff and his fiancée influence each other's sleep patterns?
{% endblockquote %}

He presents raw time-series sleep data collected using
[larklife](http://www.lark.com/products/lark-life/experience), then attempts to answer this question in a couple of
different ways. He first displays a *timeline visualization* of peak
overnight activity:

{% img https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-nU3qiQKycow/UIbogGdHsGI/AAAAAAAAAHY/Ax23iCZB98M/s640/jeffzira-peak-vis.jpg %}

Since his peaks often occur slightly after her peaks, he uses this as
evidence that she's waking him up. He also shows the *difference signal*
between their sleep patterns, but finds this less than conclusive:

{% img https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-GAskT1r-gP4/UIbogcHUqCI/AAAAAAAAAHc/XbCl5IvAves/s640/jeffzira-diff-vis.jpg %}

After watching this talk, I immediately thought:

{% blockquote %}
Is there a more precise way to answer this question?
{% endblockquote %}

## The Mathematics

Note that term *difference signal* above. Any time-series dataset is a signal,
which means the powerful tools of signal processing can be applied!

Let the sleep patterns of Jeff and his fiancée be the signals
$ S(\tau) $ and $ T(\tau) $ respectively. Let $ f(S(\tau), T(\tau)) $ be the
*similarity* between those signals. Ignoring (for now) the fact that $ f $
remains undefined, I'm looking for the *time shift* $ t $ that maximizes

$$
f(S(\tau + t), T(\tau))
$$

(As a side note, the *difference signal* is a new signal
$ R(\tau) = S(\tau) - T(\tau) $.)

First, however, I need a reasonable *similarity function* $ f $. The answer
lies in *cross-correlation:*

{% blockquote Wikipedia http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-correlation %}
In signal processing, cross-correlation is a measure of similarity of two waveforms as a function of a time-lag applied to one of them.
{% endblockquote %}

Perfect! The core of cross-correlation is an integral that looks suspiciously
like [convolution](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convolution), except that we have a term $ T(\tau + t) $ instead
of $ T(\tau - t) $:

$$
(S \star T)(t) = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} S^{\ast}(\tau) T(\tau + t) \mathrm{d}\tau
$$

The desired $ t $ is the *global maximum* of this cross-correlation function.

Given two discrete periodic signals `S1`, `S2` of equal length, this
cross-correlation integral can easily be computed:

{% codeblock lang:js %}
function crossCorrelation(S1, S2, t) {
  var N = S1.length;
  t = t % N;
  if (t < 0) {
    t += N;
  }
  for (var tau = 0; tau < N; tau++) {
    C += S1[tau] * S2[(tau + t) % N];
  }
  return C / N;
}
{% endcodeblock %}

It can be hard to visualize what this is doing, though, so I've provided
a [quick demo](#quick-demo) below.

cross-correlation. Try different combinations of functions and *see where
the cross-correlation is maximized!*

### Back To The Original Motivation

Given the two sleep signals $ S, T $ above, cross-correlation makes it
possible to answer these questions:

- Who wakes up first? By how long?
- Accounting for the time shift in awakening, how closely do the sleep
  patterns match?

This gives a *more rigorous* sense of whether the peaks in nighttime activity
actually do coincide. It also identifies the person who wakes up first and
how much earlier they wake up.

While simply *looking at the data* can be very effective, rigorous analysis
has definite value if you plan to *carry out further experiments.* Armed with
cross-correlation data, you can answer questions like

{% blockquote %}
Okay, I switched to a separately-coiled mattress. How well does that prevent
us from waking each other up?
{% endblockquote %}

In general, *signal processing* techniques can be highly useful in examining
time-series data.

## Up Next

This was a slight diversion from my plan to talk about
upcoming experiments, which I'll return to in my next few posts. If you
just can't wait, here's a *quick summary:*

- **Persistent location tracking:** by *constantly tracking my location*, I'll
  have an additional dataset to correlate against.
- **Diet:** by *taking meal photos*, *tagging foods*, and *measuring
  stress levels after meals*, I'll get a better idea of how different
  foods affect me.
- **Finances:** by *tracking where Valkyrie and I spend our money*, we'll
  hopefully be able to better control our discretionary spending.
- **Loss Aversion:** by *experimenting with tracking methods*, I'll see if this
  is something that can be meaningfully tracked over time.
