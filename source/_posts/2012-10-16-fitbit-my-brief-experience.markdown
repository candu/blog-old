In this post, I discuss my experiences using the popular
[Fitbit](LINK) fitness tracker.

## First, A Broad View

### Data Collection Is Easy (And It's Getting Easier)

Devices like the
[Fitbit](LINK),
[Zeo](LINK),
[Nike FuelBand](LINK),
[BodyMedia sensor](LINK)
and others have transformed data collection at the consumer level.
Each new generation of phones comes with more sensors and more software
for using those sensors. From
[Pachube](LINK) to [Intel](LINK), many people are interested in building a
[data commons](LINK) to store and share the world's self-tracking data.

### Data Collection Isn't The Only Problem

In a world of dead-simple data collection and plentiful devices, harder
questions present themselves:

- What should I track? What is the right device for my needs?
- As I gather more data, how do I make sense of it?

## My Time With Fitbit

TODO: get screenshot of graph from Fitbit

benefits:
  - practical: unobtrusive, fairly sleek design, long battery life,
    wireless syncing
  - persistent tracking with minimal maintenance
  - small behavior modifications: walking the long way to get extra steps
  - competition, community: two sides of the same awesome coin

problems:
  - practical: easy to lose, terminals get corroded by sweat, wristband
    is cheap and stretches out
  - sleeping with Fitbit == 2000 step difference!
  - midnight-to-midnight days, rather than sleep-to-sleep
  - de-incentivizes activities like cycling, swimming, climbing, etc.
    that can't be measured
  - API: had to ask for access to the minute-level data, raises question
    of data ownership
  - dashboard: I didn't choose this layout, it chose me :(

larger questions:
  - who owns self-tracking data?
  - what would my ideal device (or overall tracking setup) look like?
  - persistent tracking: is "tracking for the sake of tracking" worth it,
    or should we be more selective?
