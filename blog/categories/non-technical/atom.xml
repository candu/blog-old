<a href="http://www.fitbit.com/">Fitbit</a> fitness tracker.</p>

<h2 id="my-time-with-fitbit">My Time With Fitbit</h2>

<p>I started using the <a href="http://www.fitbit.com/product">Fitbit Ultra</a> on April 11, 2012:</p>

<p><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-BbdI4RDLEPg/UH4U2PwH7AI/AAAAAAAAAFI/cdY5hnwl3so/s400/steps-april.jpg"></p>

<p>Over the following three months, I walked, ran, and otherwise jostled my Fitbit
about a good deal:</p>

<img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-yzUccJOlbCQ/UH4U36eSCJI/AAAAAAAAAFk/Qmx-r-swHwc/s800/lifetime-distance.jpg"></p>

<p>Somewhere around July 12, tragedy struck: <em>I lost my Fitbit.</em></p>

<p><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/–zc0squq1yo/UH4U1nCGuQI/AAAAAAAAAE8/aDOP5c1f0pw/s400/steps-july.jpg"></p>

<h3 id="the-good">The Good</h3>

<p>My initial impression was ecstatic. Fitbit didn’t look like your average
pedometer:</p>

<p><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-eLa1uqTeKRg/UH4U5G5GSNI/AAAAAAAAAF0/RiNA89GciGQ/s288/fitbit.jpg">

<p><em>Wireless syncing</em> and <em>long battery life</em> sweetened the deal. This was a vast step
up from my pen-and-paper recovery journal. I was doing <em>serious</em> self-tracking
with <em>serious</em> devices now.</p>

<p>As I started to use it, I noticed <em>small changes in my behavior.</em> I’d walk an
extra few blocks to the employee shuttle. I’d buy fewer groceries at the market,
forcing myself to walk there more frequently. I’d take late-evening walks if I
felt my daily step count was too low. Each change was minor, but they often
added up to <em>thousands of additional steps per day.</em></p>

<p>I’d also revel in more extreme bursts of exercise. A hike in the Marin headlands
netted me the 30 000 step badge. I pocketed the 200 floors badge after a
<a href="http://goo.gl/maps/jB7fa">ride up to Tilden</a>.</p>

<p>For the first time, I could also see how much I was sleeping:</p>

<p><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-QGWtSgEdMz8/UH4U5qNFyXI/AAAAAAAAAF8/5dGzfE_2YBk/s400/sleep-graph.jpg"></p>

<p><em>Great gouts of data</em> poured into my life, chartporn galore for an unrepentant 
math addict. Soon it even became a quasi-social activity as my leaderboard
filled up with my Fitbit-using friends.</p>

<p>All in all, the Fitbit seemed like a fantastic way to turbocharge my exercise
patterns.</p>

<h3 id="the-bad">The Bad</h3>

<p>My wife, <a href="http://www.eecs.berkeley.edu/~valkyrie/">Valkyrie Savage</a>, also had a Fitbit. In the instructions, women
were suggested to wear the Fitbit on their bra strap for the ultimate in
clandestine self-tracking. This soon unearthed a glaring problem:</p>

<p><blockquote><p>Sweat is corrosive to metal.</p></blockquote></p>

<p>In particular, the internal leads started to corrode, and before long she was
unable to connect it to the base station. After a quick phone call, Fitbit
agreed to replace the device at no cost; we weren’t the first users to have
this problem, and they were in the process of changing the documentation.</p>

<p>Still, the experience soured the deal a bit. Had they never field-tested it with
women?</p>

<p>While we waited for the replacement, I noticed something else: my wristband
had stretched out and was now loose on my wrist. This was a minor detail,
but it added to a growing concern that the Fitbit Ultra <em>might not be
durable enough to withstand our protracted Savage-ing.</em></p>

<p>Her second Fitbit finally arrived, and we were back into the self-tracking groove.
We took our Fitbits everywhere: walking, running, playing soccer, cycling,
and…wait, no, <em>Valkyrie couldn’t take it swimming.</em> Actually, it didn’t
measure our cycling accurately, it was useless for my static
bodyweight exercises, and it couldn’t track our occasional indoor climbing
stints effectively either. <em>It was discouraging us from doing the activities
we loved most!</em></p>

<h3 id="the-ugly">The Ugly</h3>

<p>As we kept up our co-tracking, Valkyrie and I noticed a curious effect.
There were several days where we spent the whole day together doing the
exact same things, and yet <em>I would always be 1000-2000 steps ahead.</em> Our stride lengths
and heights are nearly equal. What was going on?</p>

<p>We tried wearing the Fitbits in the same locations on our bodies. No effect.
We tried counting steps while we were out together. The counts matched up.
The solution came by accident. With the wristband getting more stretched out
by the day, I finally started taking my Fitbit off when going to bed.
going to bed.</p>

<p>Aha! There was the difference: <em>it was counting every tiny
movement I made while asleep.</em> This effect was never mentioned in the
manual. It hadn’t occurred to us that <em>our data might not be comparable!</em></p>

<p>Meanwhile, my interest in Quantified Self was gradually intensifying. I
decided to check out the <a href="http://dev.fitbit.com/">Fitbit API</a>, hoping to create something like
<a href="https://github.com/beaugunderson/zeo-crossfilter">zeo-crossfilter</a> for Fitbit.
This immediately hit a snag: <em>to get the minute-by-minute data, you need 
Partner API access.</em></p>

<p><blockquote><p>Partner API allows to fetch the intraday data points with 1 minute detail level for several user resources</p><footer><strong>Fitbit Partner API</strong> <cite><a href='https://wiki.fitbit.com/display/API/Fitbit+Partner+API'>wiki.fitbit.com/display/API/&hellip;</a></cite></footer></blockquote></p>

<p>Fortunately, <a href="http://pavelrisenberg.com/">Pavel Risenberg</a>
happily extended this access upon request, and I soon had
<a href="https://github.com/candu/fitbit-crossfilter">fitbit-crossfilter</a> up and
working.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-Ys7TdGOf2kI/UH4U6Tb2pRI/AAAAAAAAAGE/yVHssco65NU/s640/fitbit-crossfilter.jpg"></p>

<p>Again, though, there was that sour taste. <em>Why not provide this access by default?</em>
A bit of digging around the site revealed a likely culprit:
<a href="http://www.fitbit.com/premium/about">Fitbit Premium</a>.
Users can pay to turn Fitbit into a personal trainer, gaining access
to more powerful data reports and goal-setting tools.</p>

<h3 id="the-verdict">The Verdict</h3>

<p><em>Was the Fitbit useful for me?</em> As a way to encourage walking: definitely.
As a lightweight persistent self-tracking device: mostly. As part of an
exercise program that meant something to me: not really.</p>

<p>I was left with a strong suspicion that <em>I wasn’t in their target demographic.</em> I was
already fairly active. 10 000 steps was more of a baseline than a goal. I didn’t
really need to walk more, and <em>I couldn’t trust it</em> to accurately track the types
of exercise I enjoy most.</p>

<p>This is an important lesson for aspiring Quantified Self entrepreneurs:</p>

<p><blockquote><p>Your product is personal by nature.</p></blockquote></p>

<p>Your product will encounter
<a href="http://quantifiedself.com/2012/08/nir-eyal-knowing-your-behaviour-type-from-gary-wolf-on-vimeo/">different behaviors</a>,
needs, and goals. <em>You are not everyone.</em> You will never understand most of these
behaviors, needs, and goals firsthand. No amount of user studies,
A/B testing, or market research will save you from this fundamental truth.</p>

<p>The only way out is to <em>give users control.</em> Let them tinker, mashup, share,
and explore. <em>Let them decide what your product means to them.</em></p>

<h2 id="questions-from-my-time-as-a-fitbit-user">Questions From My Time As A Fitbit User</h2>

<h3 id="who-owns-self-tracking-data">Who Owns Self-Tracking Data?</h3>

<p>Surround your pullquote like this {" text to be quoted "}</p>

<p>The analogy is apt. Much as the old fiefdoms laid claim to your land and labor,
these fiefdoms <em>use your data and your data entry labor to enrich
themselves.</em> Much as the old fiefdoms provided vital services in exchange
for this taxation, you receive the <em>benefit of services like search and
social networking.</em> Much as the old fiefdoms fought each other relentlessly for
economic gain, these fiefdoms <em>wage war over users and intellectual property.</em></p>

<p>This is not necessarily bad. As a result of these data fiefdoms, we have many
services that might not otherwise exist. By selling your self-tracking data
back to you, Fitbit is <em>able to fund the provision of tools for managing and
improving your fitness.</em> Those tools are generally of reasonable quality,
and are likely to improve over time.</p>

<p>However, if you want to make your own tools, <em>you’re largely out of
luck.</em> You can pay for different tools via Fitbit Premium, but there’s no
guarantee that those tools will be better for <em>you.</em> Your only other
recourse is to navigate the API documentation and contact the right people for
better data access. Even with that access, you still only have
minute-by-minute data. You have no idea how Fitbit maps between raw
accelerometer readings and steps, and definitely no opportunity to improve that
mapping. To take my example, <em>I can’t tweak the step detection algorithms to
measure cycling accurately.</em></p>

<p>Even though the average person won’t care to make these improvements,
<em>a few people will.</em> This recalls the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=3563106890027">reddit maxim</a>:</p>

<p><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-Y4JWrp5wBmU/UH4U4dNSO-I/AAAAAAAAAFs/qCIibiyvafk/s400/give-a-damn.jpg"></p>

<p><em>There’s a tension here.</em> This is how better products are built, but it’s not
in Fitbit’s interest to let just anyone do that in a completely unconstrained
fashion. If they do, they go out of business.</p>

<h3 id="what-is-my-ideal-fitness-tracking-device">What Is My Ideal Fitness Tracking Device?</h3>

<p>It would be:</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>activity-agnostic,</strong> with the ability to track diverse forms of
physical activity.</li>
  <li><strong>water-resistant.</strong> (I won’t ask for waterproof, since I’m not much of a
swimmer myself, but it should be able to handle light rain and a little
sweat.)</li>
  <li><strong>data-transparent,</strong> allowing me to get at the raw data without going
through a vendor API. (I note that <a href="https://github.com/qdot/libfitbit">libfitbit</a> exists as an
attempt to reverse-engineer Fitbit, but I haven’t played around with it.)</li>
</ol>

<p>I haven’t looked into <a href="http://www.bodymedia.com/">BodyMedia</a> or
<a href="https://fluxtream.com">Fluxtream</a>, but they both look promising.</p>

<h3 id="is-persistent-tracking-useful">Is Persistent Tracking Useful?</h3>

<p><blockquote><p>Yes, but only if you can analyze the data as quickly as you generate it.</p></blockquote></p>

and talk briefly about my first experiment.</p>

<h3 id="first-a-video-for-context">First, A Video For Context</h3>

<p>If you’ve already seen my talk on panic attacks, feel free to skip to the next
section.</p>

<iframe src="http://player.vimeo.com/video/45860129" width="500" height="281" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
<p><a href="http://vimeo.com/45860129">Evan Savage - Panic</a> from <a href="http://vimeo.com/quantifiedself">Gary Wolf</a> on <a href="http://vimeo.com">Vimeo</a>.</p>

<h3 id="seeking-help">Seeking Help</h3>

<p>My success in confronting panic began with a <em>simple yet powerful insight</em>:</p>

<p><blockquote><p>I don’t know how to deal with this, but someone else might.</p></blockquote></p>

<p>Once I had this insight, <em>seeing a psychologist</em> was the natural next step.</p>

<ul>
  <li>As a <em>domain expert</em>, the psychologist knows where to find relevant
information for a wide variety of conditions. I can ask her for further
resources and receive <em>highly targeted recommendations</em>.</li>
  <li>As a <em>stranger</em>, the psychologist provides an <em>impartial and
non-judgmental sounding board</em>. I can discuss my thoughts, fears, and
experiences with her and feel safe doing so.</li>
</ul>

<p>As a side note, the former point reflects some of the promise of the
<em>Quantified Mass</em>. When you have a specific problem,
there is a subtle but crucial difference between</p>

<p><blockquote><p>What did others try?</p></blockquote></p>

<p>and</p>

<p><blockquote><p>What should I try next?</p></blockquote></p>

<p>While answering the first question is helpful, I’d argue that answering the
second is an order of magnitude more helpful.</p>

<h3 id="basic-research">Basic Research</h3>

<p>My psychologist recommended the
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Anxiety-Phobia-Workbook-Edmund-Bourne/dp/1572248912">Anxiety and Phobia Workbook</a>.
As a survey of known symptoms, studies, treatments, and experiences, it gave me
a <em>much broader set of external inputs</em> to draw on. After reading the workbook
cover to cover, the natural next step was now to <em>combine these inputs into
something actionable</em>.</p>

<p>I identified specific treatments that seemed easy to implement. In retrospect,
my initial list was pretty large:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Abdominal Breathing</strong>: by learning to <em>breathe from the abdomen</em>, you train
your body to avoid the sort of shallow chest breathing that can worsen an
attack.</li>
  <li><strong>Deep Relaxation</strong>: through <em>meditation, progressive muscle relaxation, or
other prolonged exercises</em>, you remove sources of physical tension in the body.</li>
  <li><strong>Daily Exercise</strong>: with <em>30 minutes of exercise per day</em>, you reduce overall
stress and increase fitness.</li>
  <li><strong>Positive Self-Talk</strong>: by <em>replacing internal
monologues</em> like “oh no, I’m having a heart attack” with more positive ones
like “I’ve dealt with this before, I’m in control”, you stop this
mental feedback loop from making your attack worse.</li>
  <li><strong>Desensitization</strong>: by <em>gradually exposing yourself to panic triggers in a
safe environment</em>, you sever the mental links that tie those triggers to
panic.</li>
  <li><strong>Assertiveness</strong>: by <em>expressing yourself in a constructive and
assertive manner</em>, you gain a sense of control over your environment
that is also useful in thwarting an attack.</li>
  <li><strong>Diet Modification</strong>: by <em>eliminating or reducing consumption of caffeine,
simple sugars, and alcohol</em>, you reduce baseline stress.</li>
  <li><strong>Supplements</strong>: by <em>taking B-complex and C vitamins</em>, your body gets the
raw materials necessary to regulate stress.</li>
</ul>

<p>All of these take <em>at most 30 minutes per day</em>, and many are <em>passive habits</em>
that rely on <em>small behavior modifications</em>.
<a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/268817716510713/">Small changes in habit</a>
are often more effective than large changes, as they are <em>easier to maintain</em>.</p>

<h2 id="my-first-experiment">My First Experiment</h2>

<p>Building this list led me to another question:</p>

<p><blockquote><p>How will I know if my condition is improving?</p></blockquote></p>

<p>This is where <em>self-tracking</em> comes in. To answer this question, I needed
to know what I was doing and whether it was working. I decided that I would
keep a <em>recovery journal</em>, which I divided into four sections.</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Weekly Practice Record</strong>: this was an overview of my activity. Every day,
I would check off each treatment I successfully followed. I also had areas
for weekly goals and notes.</li>
  <li><strong>Daily Record of Exercise</strong>: every day, I would fill in either the duration
and type of exercise or a reason for not exercising.</li>
  <li><strong>Food Diary</strong>: every day, I would fill in my caffeine, sugar, and alcohol
consumption. I would also fill whether I took B-complex and C vitamins.</li>
  <li><strong>Panic Triggers and Responses</strong>: if I experienced a panic attack, I would
note the date and time, the severity, what triggered it, what specific
symptoms I experienced, and how I dealt with it.</li>
</ol>

<p>You can view and print the log sheets
<a href="https://docs.google.com/folder/d/0B4lRh7NaNiTMNDE2ODE3ZTMtNWVjZC00M2VlLTg1NWUtZjdmZTlkMGI2NTZm/edit">on Google Docs</a>.</p>

<p>Keeping these logs took no more than five minutes per day. Tracking mechanisms
are most effective when they have <em>low overhead</em>, as this lowers the willpower
barrier to using them regularly.</p>

<h3 id="a-diversion-on-self-tracking-design">A Diversion On Self-Tracking Design</h3>

<p><blockquote><p>How can we design systems when we don’t know what we’re doing?</p><footer><strong>Bret Victor</strong> <cite><a href='http://worrydream.com/LadderOfAbstraction/'>Up and Down the Ladder of Abstraction</a></cite></footer></blockquote></p>

<p>Although I cribbed the individual sections almost verbatim from the workbook,
their specific combination has some curious results.</p>

<p>The <em>broad</em> view of Section 1 is complemented by the <em>deep</em> view of Sections
2-3. In the data visualization world, having
<a href="http://worrydream.com/LadderOfAbstraction/">multiple levels of abstraction</a>
helps the viewer grasp the whole picture without losing their hold on specifics.
By looking at the broad view, I knew my overall progress; by looking at the
deep views, I could see the areas I needed to focus on.</p>

<p>Section 4 provides the <em>feedback loop</em>. Without this section,
I can’t answer my earlier question:</p>

<p><blockquote><p>How will I know if my condition is improving?</p></blockquote></p>

<p>My self-tracking was very <em>goal-directed</em>: I had a specific problem that I
wanted to solve. There is another kind of self-tracking, one that I
think many people ignore, and that is <em>exploratory</em> self-tracking.</p>

<p>Imagine this same journal without Section 4. None of the treatments are
specific to panic, so they could reasonably be followed by anyone. Without the
goal of confronting panic, there is <em>greater room for curiosity</em>. You could add
more experiments, play with correlations, ask weirder questions like
“what happens if I eat a lot of <a href="http://quantifiedself.com/butter/">butter</a>?”
<em>Without imposing goals, there is no failure or success</em>, and that can be both
a curse and a blessing. The curse is that you might not measurably improve
yourself. The blessing is that you might not care!</p>

<p>I believe that, much like a
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reinforcement_learning">reinforcement learning</a>
system, the Quantified Self community <em>needs both modes of self-tracking to
thrive</em>.</p>

    <updated>2012-10-02T21:34:00-07:00</updated>
    <id>http://candu.github.com/blog/2012/10/02/welcome-to-quantified-savagery</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I’m <a href="http://cv.savageevan.com/">Evan Savage</a> and I’d like to welcome you
to Quantified Savagery. I recently left my job at Facebook to focus on
exploring the
<a href="http://quantifiedself.com/">Quantified Self</a>,
and I’m super-excited to share those explorations here on my new blog.</p>

<p>In this first post, I’ll explain the Quantified Self, give you a sense of
what I’ll be posting in the near future, and provide some helpful tips on
reading this blog.</p>

<!--more-->

<h2 id="what-is-the-quantified-self">What is the Quantified Self?</h2>

<p>I’ve had to explain this countless times to friends, family, and
co-workers: why did I leave
<a href="http://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Facebook-Reviews-E40772.htm">one of the world’s best employers</a>
to explore a field most people haven’t even heard of?
I usually start by name-dropping
<a href="http://www.fitbit.com/">Fitbit</a> or <a href="http://nikeplus.nike.com/plus/">Nike+</a> as
prominent examples of personal data collection and analysis. I then do some
semi-coherent hand-waving about the vast potential of data collection and
analysis. All of this is really just an attempt to cover up the fact
that <em>I don’t really know</em>.</p>

<p>That doesn’t really cut it as an explanation for a major life decision,
though, so let’s look a bit deeper.</p>

<p>The Quantified Self
<a href="http://quantifiedself.com/">community website</a> has this tagline:</p>

<p><blockquote><p>self knowledge through numbers</p></blockquote></p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>self:</strong> you seek to answer <em>your</em> questions.</li>
  <li><strong>knowledge:</strong> in doing this, you gain an <em>awareness</em> of your behaviors and
motivations.</li>
  <li><strong>through numbers:</strong> this process is driven by <em>data</em> gathered from sensors,
journals, and any other tools at your disposal.</li>
</ul>

<p>This is a good first-level approximation: you <em>gather</em> your data, <em>analyze</em> it,
and <em>interpret</em> the analysis to become more <em>self-aware</em>.</p>

<p>Surround your pullquote like this {" text to be quoted "}</p>

<p>As I said before, though, this is only a first-level approximation. There are
two main ways in which Quantified Self can achieve greater awesomeness:
<em>Quantified Mass</em> and <em>Qualified Self</em>.</p>

<h3 id="quantified-mass">Quantified Mass</h3>

<p>As Gary Wolf pointed out in his
<a href="http://www.onthemedia.org/people/gary-wolf/">interview with On the Media</a>,
self-tracking doesn’t lead to self-obsession but rather to group-awareness.
In asking our own questions, we find that these questions are important to
others as well. When many people gather comparable datasets to answer the
same questions, there’s an opportunity to extract insights
that could benefit us all.</p>

<p>Scalable <em>mass</em> insights have massive power. Taking a 1% chunk out of the
American obesity epidemic might not sound impressive, but that’s potentially
a <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/bethhoffman/2012/08/16/what-the-obesity-epidemic-costs-us-infographic/">$6 billion impact</a>
on direct and indirect costs. And that’s just in the United States, which
counts for a tiny slice of the global mobile userbase.</p>

<p>Many of the requisite data mining tools already
exist, but they’re being employed to increase advertising click-through rates
by 1%. The engineers building these tools aren’t indifferent to societal
problems; rather, <em>the datasets to solve those problems largely don’t exist yet.</em>
Once they do, the quantified mass can start driving these massive-scale
incremental wins.</p>

<h3 id="qualified-self">Qualified Self</h3>

<p><blockquote><p>Not everything that counts can be counted,<br/>and not everything that can be counted counts.</p></blockquote></p>

<p>Our perception of life is rarely numerical. Much more often, it is visual,
auditory, tactile, or experiential. 
The problem with data is that you can’t
<a href="http://worrydream.com/#!/KillMath">see</a> or
<a href="http://blog.makezine.com/2009/02/08/haptic-compass/">feel</a> them.
Even the best data scientists use
data only as a means of
<a href="http://www.ted.com/talks/hans_rosling_shows_the_best_stats_you_ve_ever_seen.html">telling a story</a>.</p>

<p>Put another way, this awareness process starts with qualitative questions
and ends with qualitative answers. Data is the intermediate representation,
one we use for its unique ability to permit detailed analysis. Ultimately,
though, we’re going to ask questions like</p>

<p><blockquote><p>How can I improve my fitness?</p></blockquote></p>

<p>and expect answers like</p>

<p><blockquote><p>By finding training partners. By doing more engaging athletic<br/>activities. By setting aside regularly scheduled time.</p></blockquote></p>

<p>We’re going to need moral support. We’re going to give and receive advice.
We’re going to have conversations and <em>tell stories</em> about our personal
struggles with fitness.</p>

<p>These qualified aspects of self-awareness are arguably the most important
to us. <em>Data provide a stepping-stone</em>, something we can build upon
to address these aspects. By building systems designed for the qualified self,
we can bring the benefits of the quantified self to everyone.</p>

<h3 id="back-to-the-quantified-self">Back to the Quantified Self</h3>

<p>That sums up why I’m so excited about Quantified Self: there really is an
enormous potential here to revolutionize our lives on both the global/societal
and individual levels.
It’s also a fantastically diverse field, one that connects hackers and 
doctors and entrepreneurs and teachers and artists through mutual pursuit of
insanely lofty goals.</p>

<h2 id="upcoming-content">Upcoming Content</h2>

<p>The next few posts will detail my experiences <em>dealing with panic
disorder through self-tracking</em>. I gave a talk about this to the Bay Area
Quantified Self community, which you can

for some initial context.</p>

<h2 id="how-to-read-this-blog">How To Read This Blog</h2>

<p>Although this is a blog about personal data, one of my primary goals is to
make the thoughts and insights shared here accessible to a broad audience.
You can filter what you read with these categories:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="http://candu.github.com/blog/categories/non-technical/" class="category">Non-Technical</a>:
expect to see insights, thoughts, discussions, descriptions
of planned experiments, and post-mortems. I might link to articles, studies,
or books that provide context, but I’ll try to summarize the relevant
parts.</li>
  <li><a href="http://candu.github.com/blog/categories/technical/" class="category">Technical</a>:
expect to see code, statistical analysis, $ \LaTeX $ formulae,
links to <a href="https://github.com/candu">Github</a> repos, and algorithm
descriptions. I’ll assume familiarity with programming and mathematics, or
at least a willingness to learn.</li>
</ul>

<p>In addition, many of my posts will be connected to one or more experiments.
For instance, my upcoming posts on self-tracking to address panic disorder will
fall under the <a href="http://candu.github.com/blog/categories/panic/" class="category">Panic</a> category.
For every experiment, I’ll attempt to post
content in both the
<a href="http://candu.github.com/blog/categories/non-technical/" class="category">Non-Technical</a> and
<a href="http://candu.github.com/blog/categories/technical/" class="category">Technical</a> categories.</p>

<p>Of course, I’ll be glad to answer any questions you have, technical or
otherwise!</p>
