    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I spent a few weeks in the not-so-frozen Canadian northlands over the winter
holidays. While there, I had the chance to visit an old childhood favorite:
the <a href="http://ontariosciencecentre.ca/">Ontario Science Centre</a>, six floors of science-based awesomeness.
One of their current exhibits, the <a href="http://ontariosciencecentre.ca/aging/">Amazing Aging Machine</a>, uses a
computer vision software package called <a href="http://aprilage.com/">APRIL</a> to predict how your
face will change over the next 50 years.</p>

<p>In this post, I explore my results from that exhibit alongside a customized
aging I performed using the <a href="http://www.aprilage.com/AprilAPI_V2.pdf">APRIL API</a>.</p>

<h2 id="present-me">Present Me</h2>

<p>It’s not the most flattering photo, but here I am at 26:</p>

<p><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-8qaAivSLFrI/UQrbKiU3JZI/AAAAAAAAARY/9e7IvKZUB00/s288/aging1.jpg"></p>

<h2 id="future-me">Future Me</h2>

<h3 id="take-one-amazing-aging-machine">Take One: Amazing Aging Machine</h3>

<p>First, my face balloons out massively:</p>

<p><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-LCFkNNtDiJg/UQrbKwGOIQI/AAAAAAAAARg/SS9o98axBtU/s288/aging2.jpg"></p>

<p>Next, my cheek bones set downwards:</p>

<p><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-VZhuI1uOVQk/UQrbLTKdBXI/AAAAAAAAARo/LHKV6cGEBGA/s288/aging3.jpg">
<img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-aNcc-FC_4yk/UQrbL53IPpI/AAAAAAAAARs/DRf3ySCxPs4/s288/aging4.jpg"></p>

<p>Finally, my face leans up and wrinkles a tiny bit:</p>

<p><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-F8xBzpDWsM4/UQrbMUOukwI/AAAAAAAAAR0/cRqPDd_wYPM/s288/aging5.jpg"></p>

<h3 id="take-two-april-api">Take Two: APRIL API</h3>

<p>For this run, I had access to the raw aging metadata, so I could see
exactly how old APRIL thought I was at each point in the aging sequence.</p>

<p>From 26 to 28, there’s not much change:</p>

<p><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-u36fDGLeI0Y/UQrbNrKtZyI/AAAAAAAAASE/NQSn0Y5uCng/s288/age28.jpg"></p>

<p>Then, by age 35, my face elongates slightly:</p>

<p><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-cRxKskiAyos/UQrbOiA_OjI/AAAAAAAAASM/GBFlRfZtXnc/s288/age35.jpg"></p>

<p>I while away the next couple of decades in relative facial stasis. The
most pronounced change is in my skin, which pales gradually with age:</p>

<p><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-gYCoSmKbBDw/UQrbO46gohI/AAAAAAAAASY/X8RoWKpGT_8/s288/age47.jpg">
<img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-dWkaa-neumY/UQrbPgkBVtI/AAAAAAAAASg/ebWh4i14qYk/s288/age55.jpg"></p>

<p>Finally, age catches up with me, and I wrinkle into a haunted
septuagenarian:</p>

<p><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-JNBO6QMu-Xg/UQrbP9uzUUI/AAAAAAAAASo/Dj43_1l46Zo/s288/age61.jpg">
<img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-w7zx8Ql3PnM/UQrbQO2pqVI/AAAAAAAAASw/9HJrW1EUz2c/s288/age67.jpg">
<img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-RNgo0CglAjs/UQrbQtlY69I/AAAAAAAAAS0/OXD8Yqf63og/s288/age72.jpg"></p>

<p>A few changes, each very minor, contribute to my forlorn expression over
these last three photos.</p>

<ul>
  <li>The <em>eyes get slightly rounder</em>, as though they’re welling up.</li>
  <li><em>Wrinkling above the eyes</em> gives the impression of a furrowed brow.</li>
  <li>The face <em>elongates yet again</em>, creating a drawn expression.</li>
  <li>As part of the elongation of the face, the <em>mouth corners sag downwards</em>
into the merest hint of a frown.</li>
</ul>

<p>Note the lack of deep forehead and upper nose creases which normally
accompany the furrowed brow expression. The mere suggestion of it on the eyes
is enough to trigger our expression recognition! It’s amazing how sensitive
we are to minute variations in facial muscle position.</p>

<h3 id="summary">Summary</h3>

<p>These images provide two divergent visions for my distant future:</p>

<p><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-F8xBzpDWsM4/UQrbMUOukwI/AAAAAAAAAR0/cRqPDd_wYPM/s288/aging5.jpg">
<img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-RNgo0CglAjs/UQrbQtlY69I/AAAAAAAAAS0/OXD8Yqf63og/s288/age72.jpg"></p>

<p>For comparison, here’s my father in his late 50s, looking quite a bit happier:</p>

<h2 id="why-were-those-so-different">Why Were Those So Different?</h2>

<p><blockquote><p>…the machine uses state-of-the-art aging software developed in partnership with Aprilage Development Inc. of Toronto to add decades to the faces of 8-12 year olds.</p><footer><strong>The Amazing Aging Machine</strong> <cite><a href='http://ontariosciencecentre.ca/aging/'>ontariosciencecentre.ca/aging/&hellip;</a></cite></footer></blockquote></p>

<p>The Amazing Aging Machine is calibrated for ages 8-12, likely to match 
the Ontario Science Centre’s target demographic. (Sadly, I couldn’t find
detailed visitor demographic data!) In my case, this creates an awkward
puffy look: it’s applying changes in facial structure through adolescence,
when much of our bone growth occurs.</p>

<p>By contrast, the APRIL API asks for your current age, allowing it to more
correctly calibrate its models. As a result, the second set of faces exhibits
relatively little change in shape.</p>

<h2 id="what-do-i-get-out-of-this">What Do I Get Out Of This?</h2>

<p>Although my face is unlikely to match either of these faces at 72, this
experiment provides some insight into how our faces change with age. After
all, the APRIL face aging models are based on real face data. They represent
a sort of statistical average of the aging process.</p>

<p>Also, I get the vaguely warm feeling that comes with having contributed to our
<a href="http://vimeo.com/29052688">collective intelligence</a>. I provided APRIL
with a real age-labelled face, which will likely be used to help train future
models.</p>

<h2 id="appendix-how-to-use-the-april-api">Appendix: How To Use The APRIL API</h2>

<p>For the more technically-minded, I’ve provided a quick walkthrough of the
API aging pipeline. For all the gritty details, consult the <a href="http://www.aprilage.com/AprilAPI_V2.pdf">API docs</a>.</p>

<p>Before starting, I highly recommend installing a tool like <a href="https://github.com/jmhodges/jsonpp">jsonpp</a>;
it makes it much easier to read API results.</p>

<p>The first step is manual: you need to register at <a href="http://www.ageme.com/">ageme.com</a>, then
click the confirmation link in your email.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-wuu_sRDb7qQ/UQrtRmoofNI/AAAAAAAAATE/l7CAexc1_ZY/s400/ageme_register.jpg"></p>

<p>The next step is uploading an image, but let’s check first that the API
works by retrieving our user info:</p>

<p><div class='bogus-wrapper'><notextile><figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>$ curl http://www.ageme.com/AprilAPI/users/savage.evan@gmail.com/userInfo
</span><span class='line'>{“result_code”:0,”message”:”Unauthorized”}</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure></notextile></div></p>

<p>Oops! We haven’t authenticated ourselves. The Authorization header uses a
brain-dead and highly insecure <code>base64</code> encoding:</p>

<p><div class='bogus-wrapper'><notextile><figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>$ python -c “import base64; print base64.encodestring(‘username:password’)”
</span><span class='line'>dXNlcm5hbWU6cGFzc3dvcmQ=</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure></notextile></div></p>

<p>(Obviously this isn’t my real username/password. Substitute yours above and
use the resulting <code>base64</code>-encoded string in the <code>Authorization</code> headers
below. I’ll use this bogus value to illustrate the flow.)</p>

<p>With the correct header, we can try fetching the user info again:</p>

<p><div class='bogus-wrapper'><notextile><figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
<span class='line-number'>7</span>
<span class='line-number'>8</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>$ curl -H “Authorization: Basic dXNlcm5hbWU6cGFzc3dvcmQ=” http://www.ageme.com/AprilAPI/users/savage.evan@gmail.com/userInfo | jsonpp 
</span><span class='line'>{
</span><span class='line'>  “uri”: “http://www.ageme.com/AprilAPI/users/savage.evan@gmail.com”,
</span><span class='line'>  “email”: “savage.evan@gmail.com”,
</span><span class='line'>  “tokens”: 0,
</span><span class='line'>  “numOfAgings”: 1,
</span><span class='line'>  “role”: “user”
</span><span class='line'>}</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure></notextile></div></p>

<p>Great! Now we can POST an image to the uploading endpoint with <code>curl</code>:</p>

<p><div class='bogus-wrapper'><notextile><figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>$ curl -F ‘filename=aging1.jpg’ -F ‘image=@/Users/candu/Desktop/aging1.jpg’ -H “Authorization: Basic dXNlcm5hbWU6cGFzc3dvcmQ=” http://www.ageme.com/AprilAPI/images</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure></notextile></div></p>

<p>Another manual step: before proceeding, you’ll need to purchase a token on
the <a href="http://www.ageme.com/">ageme.com</a> site. At time of writing, this cost $3.99; I looked for
active promotion codes, but couldn’t find any.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-co9vyFu4uJQ/UQrtSM1T8mI/AAAAAAAAATM/8ozrK3aiGjk/s400/ageme_buytokens.jpg"></p>

<p>With your aging token purchased, you can now create an aging document. This
lets APRIL know your age and ethnicity, which helps it to select the
appropriate models for your particular aging sequence. It also identifies the
starting image of that sequence via the <code>imageId</code> returned during image upload.</p>

<p><div class='bogus-wrapper'><notextile><figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>$ curl -H ‘Content-Type: application/json’ -d ‘{“document”: {“gender”: “male”, “age”: 26, “name”: “Evan”, “ethnicity”: “Caucasian”}, “imageId”: 2371944}}’ -H “Authorization: Basic dXNlcm5hbWU6cGFzc3dvcmQ=” http://www.ageme.com/AprilAPI/documents</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure></notextile></div></p>

<p>We’re ready to run the aging process. There’s a single method <code>detectMatchAge</code>
for performing all three steps, but I’ll break it down into the component
steps here:</p>

<p><div class='bogus-wrapper'><notextile><figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>$ curl -X POST -H “Authorization: Basic dXNlcm5hbWU6cGFzc3dvcmQ=” http://www.ageme.com/AprilAPI/users/savage.evan@gmail.com/documents/2371973/pointDetection
</span><span class='line'>$ while true; do curl -H “Authorization: Basic dXNlcm5hbWU6cGFzc3dvcmQ=” http://www.ageme.com/AprilAPI/users/savage.evan@gmail.com/documents/2371973/status; done
</span><span class='line'>$ curl -X POST -H “Authorization: Basic dXNlcm5hbWU6cGFzc3dvcmQ=” http://www.ageme.com/AprilAPI/users/savage.evan@gmail.com/documents/2371973/match
</span><span class='line'>$ while true; do curl -H “Authorization: Basic dXNlcm5hbWU6cGFzc3dvcmQ=” http://www.ageme.com/AprilAPI/users/savage.evan@gmail.com/documents/2371973/status; done
</span><span class='line'>$ curl -H ‘Content-Type: application/json’ -d ‘{“sequenceType”: “Max72”, “sequences”: [{“smoking”: 0, “sunExposure”: 0, “multiplier”: 1}]}’ -H “Authorization: Basic dXNlcm5hbWU6cGFzc3dvcmQ=” http://www.ageme.com/AprilAPI/users/savage.evan@gmail.com/documents/2371973/aging
</span><span class='line'>$ while true; do curl -H “Authorization: Basic dXNlcm5hbWU6cGFzc3dvcmQ=” http://www.ageme.com/AprilAPI/users/savage.evan@gmail.com/documents/2371973/status; done</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure></notextile></div></p>

<p>Note the <code>while</code> loops, which wait for each step to complete. Once all steps
are completed, we retrieve the aging results:</p>

<p><div class='bogus-wrapper'><notextile><figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>

</span><span class='line'>          },</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure></notextile></div></p>

<p>Finally, I wrote a bit of <a href="https://github.com/candu/quantified-savagery-files/blob/master/Aging/fetch_aging.py">Python glue</a> to fetch the URLs and name
them by age:</p>

<p><div class='bogus-wrapper'><notextile><figure class='code'> <div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>

<p>With this, we can fetch the images:</p>

<p><div class='bogus-wrapper'><notextile><figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>$ python fetch_aging.py &lt; aging_results.json</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure></notextile></div></p>

<p>And that’s it! Most of the process uses <code>curl</code>, with minimal leaning
on Python for its <code>base64</code> module.</p>

your data. </p>

<h2 id="first-a-quote">First, A Quote</h2>

<p><blockquote><p>Are we analyzing data? Then we should be manipulating the data themselves; or if we are designing an analysis of data, we should be manipulating the analytic structures themselves.</p><footer><strong>Direct Manipulation Interfaces</strong> <cite><a href='http://cleo.ics.uci.edu/teaching/Winter10/231/readings/1-HutchinsHollanNorman-DirectManipulation-HCI.pdf'>cleo.ics.uci.edu/teaching/231/&hellip;</a></cite></footer></blockquote></p>

<h2 id="the-sixfold-path-of-self-tracking">The Sixfold Path Of Self-Tracking</h2>

<p>Self-tracking is a complex process. It can be broken down into stages:</p>

<ul>
  <li><em>Intent:</em> our initial goals or motivations in deciding to self-track.</li>
  <li><em>Tools:</em> the devices or methods we use for tracking.</li>
  <li><em>Measurement:</em> collecting our data using those tools.</li>
  <li><em>Analysis:</em> extracting insights from our data.</li>
  <li><em>Interpretation:</em> creating personal meaning from those insights.</li>
  <li><em>Action:</em> responding to that personal meaning.</li>
</ul>

<p>Thanks to smartphones and cheap sensors, many of us already have the tools
necessary for measurement. The psychology of intent and action is rapidly
being explored through <a href="http://www.meetup.com/habitdesign/">Habit Design</a> and <a href="http://captology.stanford.edu/">Captology</a>, with
startups like <a href="http://lift.do/">Lift</a> and <a href="https://www.beeminder.com/">Beeminder</a> harnessing the findings
to great effect.</p>

<p><em>What are the technologies of analysis and interpretation?</em></p>

<h3 id="visualization">Visualization</h3>

<p>Visualizations, even interactive ones, are usually designed to <em>answer
specific questions</em> such as <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2012/11/07/us/politics/obamas-diverse-base-of-support.html">how did Obama win re-election?</a>
Within the context of those questions, they help us understand our data
intuitively. Outside that context, however, they are often useless.</p>

<h3 id="statisticalmathematical-software">Statistical/Mathematical Software</h3>

<p>Environments like <a href="http://www.r-project.org/">R</a> and <a href="http://www.wolfram.com/mathematica/">Mathematica</a> allow you to <em>explore
your data in meticulous detail.</em> In the hands of people like
<a href="http://blog.stephenwolfram.com/2012/03/the-personal-analytics-of-my-life/">Stephen Wolfram</a>, they are the holy grail of data analysis. For the
less technically inclined, they remain hopelessly unintuitive.</p>

<h2 id="a-middle-road">A Middle Road</h2>

<p>What we need is <em>something between the two</em>, a hybrid that exposes the
exploratory power of the latter through the intuitive interface of the former.
Such a tool would give us the opportunity to <em>explore our data as we see fit.</em>
We could ask our data questions, iterating quickly on those questions until
we reach useful insights.</p>

<p>Until we can all converse with our data with the fluency of <a href="http://www.ted.com/talks/hans_rosling_the_good_news_of_the_decade.html">Hans Rosling</a>,
there’s still room for improvement!</p>

<h2 id="datafist">datafist</h2>

<p>datafist tries to bridge this gap by providing <em>visual and gestural actions</em>
for data manipulation. This is probably easier to demonstrate than describe,
so here’s a screencast that shows an early development version of datafist
in action:</p>

<p>As you use datafist, <em>you’re constantly modifying the analysis itself.</em>
This modification takes place through <em>visual and gestural actions:</em> you
move channels to the viewer, drag out ranges of time to zoom in on, and draw
regions around interesting clusters. As you do this, the view is
<em>updated in real-time</em>, allowing you to see the effects of your actions.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In this post, I discuss my ongoing experiment with eliminating alcohol from my
diet. I use this experience to address a question: why do we find some forms of
habit change easier than others?</p>

<!-- more -->

<h2 id="background">Background</h2>

<p>As of today, <em>I’ve been completely sober for over a month.</em> I took my last drink
at <a href="http://goo.gl/maps/nSxLn">Seven’s Ale House</a> on October 13 with these
fine folks:</p>

<p><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-chtv-noAeXM/UKQNQdVUz1I/AAAAAAAAANQ/8zTq_kKfbCU/s640/sevens-pub.jpg"></p>

<p>Why did I decide to do this? One of the takeaways from my
<a href="/blog/2012/10/14/self-tracking-for-panic-another-dataset/">self-tracking for panic</a>
was that <em>I drink heavily and frequently:</em> about three drinks per day, six days
per week. The USDA recommendations are somewhat stricter:</p>

<p><blockquote><p>…“low-risk” drinking [is defined] as no more than 14 drinks a week for men and 7 drinks a week for women with no more than 4 drinks on any given day for men and 3 drinks a day for women.</p><footer><strong>Dietary Guidelines for Americans</strong> <cite><a href='http://www.cnpp.usda.gov/Publications/DietaryGuidelines/2010/DGAC/Report/D-7-Alcohol.pdf'>www.cnpp.usda.gov/Publications/&hellip;</a></cite></footer></blockquote></p>

<p><a href="http://www.alcoholscreening.org/Home.aspx">This online questionnaire</a> put my drinking level in context:</p>

<p><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-ieizYGUAwJo/UKQNQsFeBOI/AAAAAAAAANY/jZ1_09uBSqk/s800/percentile-drinking.jpg"></p>

<p><em>How much does the average American drink?</em> Using the data from
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_alcohol_consumption">this Wikipedia article</a>
and some simple calculations:</p>

<p>About $ 1.3 $ drinks per day, or roughly half of what I was drinking during my
two panic tracking periods. If you ask <a href="http://www.gallup.com/poll/156770/majority-drink-alcohol-averaging-four-drinks-week.aspx">Gallup</a>, though, they have a
different number: $ 4.2 / 7 = 0.6 $ drinks per day. <a href="http://pubs.niaaa.nih.gov/publications/RethinkingDrinking/Rethinking_Drinking.pdf">Rethinking Drinking</a>,
a pamphlet from the <a href="http://www.nih.gov/">National Institutes of Health</a>, provides yet another
look at drinking habits nationwide:</p>

<p><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-vEbziueqO8I/UKQN1vuM15I/AAAAAAAAANg/ermiP-4-0oA/s800/nih-alcohol-use.jpg"></p>

<p>(This points out a general
problem with data in the social sciences. Polling and measurement methodologies
vary widely, as do the means by which data is presented.)</p>

<p>Regardless of which source I choose to believe, <em>my data still places me above
average.</em></p>

<p>There was also a more personal reason: in <a href="/blog/2012/10/09/self-tracking-for-panic-an-even-deeper-look/">analyzing the panic data</a>,
<em>I found that caffeine wasn’t the only panic-inducing culprit.</em> By training a
<a href="https://github.com/candu/quantified-savagery-files/blob/master/Panic/recovery-journal/panic_maxent.py">maximum entropy classifier</a>, I found that high alcohol consumption was
predictive of panic attacks. <a href="/blog/2012/10/08/self-tracking-for-panic-a-deeper-look/">Dissecting my data with bash</a> supported
this hypothesis: on days where I had a panic attack, I was usually drinking
more than average both that day and the previous day.</p>

<h2 id="elimination-or-moderation">Elimination Or Moderation?</h2>

<p>So why elimination instead of moderation? Simple: <em>moderation wasn’t working.</em>
I’d been using the USDA guidelines as my goal during the two panic tracking
periods, with little success.</p>

<p>(As it happens, I was also reading <a href="http://www.emptymirrorbooks.com/beat/kerouac-big-sur.html">Big Sur</a> at the time, which contains
<a href="http://www.jackkerouac.com/">Jack Kerouac’s</a> harrowing account of <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmedhealth/PMH0001771/">delirium tremens</a>. This may
have provided some additional impetus in the decision!)</p>

<p>The <a href="http://strategicsimplicity.com/3-reasons-to-form-new-habits-slowly-and-how-i-failed">received wisdom</a> is that this sort of “cold turkey” habit change
usually leads to failure: willpower is finite, we burn out easily, there are
powerful social triggers, etc. Except:</p>

<p><blockquote><p>I didn’t find elimination harder. On the contrary, it was much easier than moderation.</p></blockquote></p>

<p>I didn’t stop going out to bars or visiting friends. I didn’t smash all the
bottles in the liquor cabinet or pour out the homebrew stash.
I didn’t enroll in any support groups or 12-step programs. What gives?</p>

<h2 id="willpower-endurance-versus-strength">Willpower: Endurance Versus Strength</h2>

<p>Elimination and moderation have different <em>decision-making profiles:</em></p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Elimination:</strong> the decision is always No. This default decision is
applied to every decision instance.</li>
  <li><strong>Moderation:</strong> the decision may be Yes or No. Each decision instance
requires a consideration of the circumstances.</li>
</ul>

<p>When I attempted to apply moderation, I found myself <em>breaking down this
consideration into a complex set of rules:</em></p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Amount:</strong> <em>Have I said Yes too much?</em></li>
  <li><strong>Cost:</strong> <em>Who pays for Yes?</em> Am I paying? Is a friend buying the next round?
Did I receive free beer in exchange for volunteer services?</li>
  <li><strong>Novelty:</strong> <em>Is this Yes different somehow?</em> Am I at a brewery I’ll likely
never visit again? Did a batch of homebrew just finish carbonation?</li>
  <li><strong>Social Pressure:</strong> <em>What are the social costs of Yes and No?</em></li>
  <li><strong>Special Occasions:</strong> <em>Does the occasion warrant changing the Yes threshold?</em>
Am I on vacation? At a fancy restaurant? Out at a concert?</li>
</ul>

<p>Taking the <a href="http://scopeblog.stanford.edu/2011/12/29/a-conversation-about-the-science-of-willpower/">willpower as muscle</a> metaphor one step further, this was
a feat of endurance. Even though amount should be the only relevant factor
here, <em>each decision instance spawned a host of smaller sub-decisions.</em></p>

<p>By contrast, the elimination strategy required only one decision for each
instance, <em>and that decision was predetermined:</em> No. It was a larger single
decision, more akin to a feat of willpower strength.</p>

<h2 id="replacing-the-routine">Replacing The Routine</h2>

<p>In <a href="http://charlesduhigg.com/">Charles Duhigg’s</a> conception of the <a href="http://charlesduhigg.com/how-habits-work/">habit loop</a>, we can’t
truly break habits; we can only <em>swap in alternate routines</em> that connect the
old cues and rewards.</p>

<p>This reminded me of a term my friend <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/pub/travis-brooks/4/668/b44">Travis Brooks</a>
used: ENAB, short for <em>Equally-attractive Non-Alcoholic Beverage.</em> There
are delicious <a href="http://shop.torani.com/Bacon-Flavored-Syrup/p/TOR-431248&amp;c=Torani@Syrups?utm_source=google&amp;utm_medium=cpc&amp;adtype=pla&amp;kw=&amp;gclid=CNL6sv21z7MCFQuCQgod-RcAgA">flavor syrups</a> and <a href="http://www.bundaberg.com/info/product_range/ginger_beer/">ginger beers</a>.
<a href="http://www.myrecipes.com/recipe/herb-infused-spa-water-10000000682668/">Spa water</a> and <a href="http://store.primowater.com/Carbonators.aspx">carbonation systems</a> lend new life to boring
<a href="http://www.dhmo.org/facts.html">dihydrogen monoxide</a>. By making non-alcoholic beverages <em>as exciting as
microbrews and Sonoma wines</em>, I tapped into my desire for exploration: here
was a whole new range of beverages to discover!</p>

<h2 id="openness-and-social-myths">Openness And Social Myths</h2>

<p>As the Alcohol Screening questionnaire said:</p>

<p><blockquote><p>Many of us think our drinking is like everyone else’s.</p></blockquote></p>

<p>While it is true that <a href="http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/the-scientific-fundamentalist/201010/why-intelligent-people-drink-more-alcohol">more educated people drink more</a>, I
encountered much less of a “drinking culture” among my friends than
I had expected.
In fact, by being open about my behavior change and the motivations
behind it, I received a good deal of social support for this decision.</p>

<p><em>Mistaken expectations are persistent in habit change:</em></p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Fear Of Isolation:</strong> We may believe that our current habits are
<em>normal or average</em>, and resist changing for fear of being regarded
as unusual.</li>
  <li><strong>Fear Of Inadequacy:</strong> We may believe that we are <em>unable or less
able</em> to change than others, and resist changing for fear we will
not be successful.</li>
</ul>

<p>In both cases, data to refute the fear-expectation may be hard to find.</p>

<h2 id="final-thoughts">Final Thoughts</h2>

<p>There are many ways in which my approach <em>could fail to work for others:</em></p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Physical Dependence:</strong> Although I drank more than average, my drinking had not
progressed to the point of chronic dependence. Alcohol withdrawal
<a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmedhealth/PMH0001769/">can be extremely serious</a>, so this unsupervised “cold turkey”
approach might be dangerous for problem drinkers or alcoholics.</li>
  <li><strong>Social Pressure:</strong> I found my friends to be understanding of my habit
change. This is not universally true, however, and in some instances
it may be necessary to rethink your personal relationships before
behavior change can occur.</li>
  <li><strong>Specific Desires:</strong> Exploration is a strong part of my identity.
Others will have different mental cues to tackle or subvert in designing
behavior change strategies.</li>
  <li><strong>Willpower:</strong> If strength and endurance are separable components of
the “willpower muscle”, it’s possible that others may find the endurance
of many small decisions easier than the strength of one big decision.</li>
</ul>

<p>These same factors made elimination an easier form of habit change for me.
Although there are general principles of <a href="http://www.meetup.com/habitdesign/">habit design</a>, I believe that
further exploration will reveal it to be a <em>highly personal process.</em></p>

<p><blockquote><p>It is one thing to say “replace the routine”, and an entirely different thing to do so.</p></blockquote></p>

<p>This is not to say that such exploration is hopeless; far from it.
If <a href="http://quantifiedself.com/2010/12/a-futurists-take-on-self-tracking-and-mindfulness/">self-tracking leads to mindfulness</a>,
perhaps this mindfulness will equip us to <em>more effectively identify and modify
the habit loops that rule our lives.</em></p>

<h2 id="what-next">What Next?</h2>

<p>My goal is not lifelong abstinence from alcohol. Rather, I’m hoping that
this will reset my baseline consumption, making it easier to practice
moderation later.</p>

<p>This experience has also demonstrated that elimination is a
viable choice for me; if I find that my moderation efforts are slipping, I
can return to a period of elimination. Having <em>proven strategies</em>
under your belt can be enormously helpful in <em>making behavior change stick.</em></p>

    <id>http://blog.savageevan.com/blog/2012/11/07/healthy-isnt-a-place-you-go-to</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In this post, I expand on some <a href="/blog/2012/10/02/welcome-to-quantified-savagery/">earlier thoughts</a> about the
nature and purpose of the <a href="http://quantifiedself.com/">Quantified Self movement</a>.
In looking at personal identity from a Quantified Self perspective, I argue
that self-tracking gives us a means for reclaiming control of that identity.</p>

<!-- more -->

<h2 id="the-revelation">The Revelation</h2>

<p>When I started down the philosophical path that ultimately led into the
Quantified Self vortex, it was with a simple question:</p>

<p><blockquote><p>How do we build game-like systems to improve our lives?</p></blockquote></p>

<p>This isn’t a new question. The <a href="http://realityisbroken.org/">Reality Is Broken</a>
thesis has long since reached tech geek mantra-hood.
<a href="https://www.superbetter.com/">SuperBetter</a> and similar games have broken ground on the
concrete implications of that mantra.</p>

<p>Much more recently, during a walk home with <a href="http://www.eecs.berkeley.edu/~valkyrie/">Valkyrie Savage</a>, I had
another thought:</p>

<p><blockquote><p>Self-tracking makes self-expertise possible.</p></blockquote></p>

<p>We may self-track for a variety of reasons, including:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>addressing symptoms:</strong> perhaps I feel overweight, underslept, or stressed
out.</li>
  <li><strong>improving habits:</strong> perhaps I want to exercise more, drink less, or read
a book each month.</li>
  <li><strong>satisfying curiosity:</strong> perhaps I’m fascinated by data visualization,
psychology, or lifehacking.</li>
</ul>

<p>Whether data collection is your focus or merely an unintended side effect,
<em>this data makes it possible to know ourselves in new ways.</em> This
self-knowledge is different from expert other-knowledge.</p>

<h2 id="self-knowledge-and-other-knowledge">Self-Knowledge and Other-Knowledge</h2>

<p>Doctors are trained to recognize general patterns of the human body.
From a diagnosis perspective, your medical history is only interesting
insofar as it allows you to be grouped together with similar patients.
That grouping is a <em>pattern profile</em> in your doctor’s mind, and it informs their
<em>expert other-knowledge</em> of you.</p>

<p>By contrast, you have intimate <em>self-knowledge</em> of your body and its symptoms.
When do they occur? After eating which foods? In which locations?
How often? How severe? The doctor will often ask these more <em>technical
questions</em> to fill in the data missing from their patterns. There are,
however, important questions that are often either missed or left barely
explored:</p>

<ul>
  <li><em>What do those symptoms cost you?</em> What do they prevent you from enjoying in
life? If you could solve one of them, which would it be?</li>
  <li>If they are preventable, <em>why do you continue the behavior that causes or
aggravates them?</em> What is the best way to get you to stop?</li>
  <li><em>How do these symptoms impact those around you?</em></li>
  <li>Do you really need medicine to deal with these symptoms? Could they be solved
with more sleep? More exercise? Healthier diet? <em>What is the least invasive
and costly means of addressing your issue?</em></li>
  <li>If you do need medicine, <em>how can you be convinced to take it?</em></li>
</ul>

<p>Surround your pullquote like this {" text to be quoted "}</p>

<p>This is not to say that experts are without value. In their current
incarnation, they fulfill much of the promise of the <a href="/blog/2012/10/02/welcome-to-quantified-savagery/">Quantified Mass</a>.
Their (hopefully) extensive training equips them with powerful insights
rooted in centuries of scientific inquiry.
Powerful as those insights are, however, <em>they are ill-suited to address 
more personal questions</em> in a way that is meaningful to you.</p>

<h2 id="personal-identity-and-place-ism">Personal Identity And Place-Ism</h2>

<p>I titled this post:</p>

<p><blockquote><p>Healthy Isn’t A Place You Go To</p></blockquote></p>

<p>What do I mean by that? Consider these popular sentiments:</p>

<ul>
  <li>To become fit, I go to the gym.</li>
  <li>To get well, I go to the doctor.</li>
  <li>To learn, I go to school.</li>
</ul>

<p>I’d argue that a lifetime of handing over control of these personal questions
<em>conditions us to associate states of being</em> (fitness, wellness, learnedness)
<em>with places</em> (gym, doctor, school). Those states become mechanical attributes
devoid of identity, knobs we go elsewhere to have others tweak for us. For
lack of a better term, I’ll call this place-ism.</p>

<p>This isn’t just philosophical posturing. There is <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=behavior+change+and+identity">growing inquiry</a>
into the hypothesis that <a href="http://wayoftheduck.com/belief-change">behavior and belief change are linked</a>.
A number of theories, such as
<a href="http://www.selfdeterminationtheory.org/theory">self-determination theory</a> and the
<a href="http://www.uri.edu/research/cprc/TTM/detailedoverview.htm">Transtheoretical Model</a>,
have sprung up in an attempt to rigorously define these processes of change.</p>

<p>If that’s the
case, training ourselves to externalize behavior change can’t be good, as it
necessarily <em>reduces our capacity for belief change.</em></p>

<h2 id="beyond-place-ism">Beyond Place-Ism…</h2>

<p>Self-tracking allows us to <em>tie mechanical questions</em> - where? when? what?
how much? - <em>to personal questions</em> and vice-versa. Data help us
answer personal questions. Personal questions help us decide what 
data are needed to answer them. This cycle <em>makes us active participants in
our own lives.</em></p>

<p>What role do experts have in this cycle? The point is not to exclude them
entirely, but rather to <em>change their role from identity gatekeepers
identity consultants.</em> By treating them as consultants, you seek advice
of your own free will and with the understanding that some of it may not
be applicable to you. You decide what role the consultant plays in your
health, your education, your overall identity.</p>

<p><blockquote><p>What if learning were not a place, but a state of being?</p></blockquote></p>

<p>Surround your pullquote like this {" text to be quoted "}</p>

<h2 id="and-back-to-gameplay">…And Back To Gameplay</h2>

<p>How are</p>

<p><blockquote><p>How do we build game-like systems to improve our lives?</p></blockquote></p>

<p>and</p>

<p><blockquote><p>Self-tracking makes self-expertise possible.</p></blockquote></p>

<p>related? <em>Self-expertise is the improvement.</em> It breaks place-ism, casts
self-knowledge and other-knowledge as complementary equals, and moves us
towards active participation. <em>Self-tracking is pervasive gameplay</em>, and
that’s awesome.</p>

    <id>http://blog.savageevan.com/blog/2012/10/03/panic</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In this post, I’ll tell the story of how I got started with self-tracking
and talk briefly about my first experiment.</p>

<!--more-->

<h2 id="my-journey-into-the-self-tracking-jungle">My Journey Into The Self-Tracking Jungle</h2>

<h3 id="first-a-video-for-context">First, A Video For Context</h3>

<p>If you’ve already seen my talk on panic attacks, feel free to skip to the next
section.</p>

<iframe src="http://player.vimeo.com/video/45860129" width="500" height="281" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
<p><a href="http://vimeo.com/45860129">Evan Savage - Panic</a> from <a href="http://vimeo.com/quantifiedself">Gary Wolf</a> on <a href="http://vimeo.com">Vimeo</a>.</p>

<h3 id="seeking-help">Seeking Help</h3>

<p>My success in confronting panic began with a <em>simple yet powerful insight</em>:</p>

<p><blockquote><p>I don’t know how to deal with this, but someone else might.</p></blockquote></p>

<p>Once I had this insight, <em>seeing a psychologist</em> was the natural next step.</p>

<ul>
  <li>As a <em>domain expert</em>, the psychologist knows where to find relevant
information for a wide variety of conditions. I can ask her for further
resources and receive <em>highly targeted recommendations</em>.</li>
  <li>As a <em>stranger</em>, the psychologist provides an <em>impartial and
non-judgmental sounding board</em>. I can discuss my thoughts, fears, and
experiences with her and feel safe doing so.</li>
</ul>

<p>As a side note, the former point reflects some of the promise of the
<em>Quantified Mass</em>. When you have a specific problem,
there is a subtle but crucial difference between</p>

<p><blockquote><p>What did others try?</p></blockquote></p>

<p>and</p>

<p><blockquote><p>What should I try next?</p></blockquote></p>

<p>While answering the first question is helpful, I’d argue that answering the
second is an order of magnitude more helpful.</p>

<h3 id="basic-research">Basic Research</h3>

<p>My psychologist recommended the
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Anxiety-Phobia-Workbook-Edmund-Bourne/dp/1572248912">Anxiety and Phobia Workbook</a>.
As a survey of known symptoms, studies, treatments, and experiences, it gave me
a <em>much broader set of external inputs</em> to draw on. After reading the workbook
cover to cover, the natural next step was now to <em>combine these inputs into
something actionable</em>.</p>

<p>I identified specific treatments that seemed easy to implement. In retrospect,
my initial list was pretty large:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Abdominal Breathing</strong>: by learning to <em>breathe from the abdomen</em>, you train
your body to avoid the sort of shallow chest breathing that can worsen an
attack.</li>
  <li><strong>Deep Relaxation</strong>: through <em>meditation, progressive muscle relaxation, or
other prolonged exercises</em>, you remove sources of physical tension in the body.</li>
  <li><strong>Daily Exercise</strong>: with <em>30 minutes of exercise per day</em>, you reduce overall
stress and increase fitness.</li>
  <li><strong>Positive Self-Talk</strong>: by <em>replacing internal
monologues</em> like “oh no, I’m having a heart attack” with more positive ones
like “I’ve dealt with this before, I’m in control”, you stop this
mental feedback loop from making your attack worse.</li>
  <li><strong>Desensitization</strong>: by <em>gradually exposing yourself to panic triggers in a
safe environment</em>, you sever the mental links that tie those triggers to
panic.</li>
  <li><strong>Assertiveness</strong>: by <em>expressing yourself in a constructive and
assertive manner</em>, you gain a sense of control over your environment
that is also useful in thwarting an attack.</li>
  <li><strong>Diet Modification</strong>: by <em>eliminating or reducing consumption of caffeine,
simple sugars, and alcohol</em>, you reduce baseline stress.</li>
  <li><strong>Supplements</strong>: by <em>taking B-complex and C vitamins</em>, your body gets the
raw materials necessary to regulate stress.</li>
</ul>

<p>All of these take <em>at most 30 minutes per day</em>, and many are <em>passive habits</em>
that rely on <em>small behavior modifications</em>.
<a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/268817716510713/">Small changes in habit</a>
are often more effective than large changes, as they are <em>easier to maintain</em>.</p>

<h2 id="my-first-experiment">My First Experiment</h2>

<p>Building this list led me to another question:</p>

<p><blockquote><p>How will I know if my condition is improving?</p></blockquote></p>

<p>This is where <em>self-tracking</em> comes in. To answer this question, I needed
to know what I was doing and whether it was working. I decided that I would
keep a <em>recovery journal</em>, which I divided into four sections.</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Weekly Practice Record</strong>: this was an overview of my activity. Every day,
I would check off each treatment I successfully followed. I also had areas
for weekly goals and notes.</li>
  <li><strong>Daily Record of Exercise</strong>: every day, I would fill in either the duration
and type of exercise or a reason for not exercising.</li>
  <li><strong>Food Diary</strong>: every day, I would fill in my caffeine, sugar, and alcohol
consumption. I would also fill whether I took B-complex and C vitamins.</li>
  <li><strong>Panic Triggers and Responses</strong>: if I experienced a panic attack, I would
note the date and time, the severity, what triggered it, what specific
symptoms I experienced, and how I dealt with it.</li>
</ol>

<p>You can view and print the log sheets
<a href="https://docs.google.com/folder/d/0B4lRh7NaNiTMNDE2ODE3ZTMtNWVjZC00M2VlLTg1NWUtZjdmZTlkMGI2NTZm/edit">on Google Docs</a>.</p>

<p>Keeping these logs took no more than five minutes per day. Tracking mechanisms
are most effective when they have <em>low overhead</em>, as this lowers the willpower
barrier to using them regularly.</p>

<h3 id="a-diversion-on-self-tracking-design">A Diversion On Self-Tracking Design</h3>

<p><blockquote><p>How can we design systems when we don’t know what we’re doing?</p><footer><strong>Bret Victor</strong> <cite><a href='http://worrydream.com/LadderOfAbstraction/'>Up and Down the Ladder of Abstraction</a></cite></footer></blockquote></p>

<p>Although I cribbed the individual sections almost verbatim from the workbook,
their specific combination has some curious results.</p>

<p>The <em>broad</em> view of Section 1 is complemented by the <em>deep</em> view of Sections
2-3. In the data visualization world, having
<a href="http://worrydream.com/LadderOfAbstraction/">multiple levels of abstraction</a>
helps the viewer grasp the whole picture without losing their hold on specifics.
By looking at the broad view, I knew my overall progress; by looking at the
deep views, I could see the areas I needed to focus on.</p>

<p>Section 4 provides the <em>feedback loop</em>. Without this section,
I can’t answer my earlier question:</p>

<p><blockquote><p>How will I know if my condition is improving?</p></blockquote></p>

<p>My self-tracking was very <em>goal-directed</em>: I had a specific problem that I
wanted to solve. There is another kind of self-tracking, one that I
think many people ignore, and that is <em>exploratory</em> self-tracking.</p>

<p>Imagine this same journal without Section 4. None of the treatments are
specific to panic, so they could reasonably be followed by anyone. Without the
goal of confronting panic, there is <em>greater room for curiosity</em>. You could add
more experiments, play with correlations, ask weirder questions like
“what happens if I eat a lot of <a href="http://quantifiedself.com/butter/">butter</a>?”
<em>Without imposing goals, there is no failure or success</em>, and that can be both
a curse and a blessing. The curse is that you might not measurably improve
yourself. The blessing is that you might not care!</p>

<p>I believe that, much like a
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reinforcement_learning">reinforcement learning</a>
system, the Quantified Self community <em>needs both modes of self-tracking to
thrive</em>.</p>
